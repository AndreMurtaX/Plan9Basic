rem DateTimeLib, second half. 20_datetime.bas covers the calendar
rem parts; check-coverage.py reported the arithmetic, the spans, the
rem differences and the clock still at 36/66.
rem
rem The map for this file came from Examples/, where the applets call
rem these in earnest and assert almost nothing. What is added here is
rem the assertion.
rem
rem Nothing asserts the wall clock. now(), date() and time() answer
rem whatever the machine says, so what is checked is the relationship
rem between them, which holds on any machine at any moment.
