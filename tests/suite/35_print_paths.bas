rem ---------------------------------------------------------------
rem PRINT, and the invariant underneath it.
rem
rem fPrint reads two different things out of the stack. The value it
rem is printing, it reads after consulting TypeStack. The separator
rem between two values, it used to read without consulting anything:
rem it took StackMem[..].s and expected to find "," or ";" there.
rem
rem That worked for one reason only. Every numeric push copied an
rem empty string over the slot on its way in, so a slot could never
rem hand PRINT the text of whatever used to live there. Until now
rem that was the compiler's doing -- a whole-record assignment moved
rem all three fields -- and it is now three handlers writing the
rem fields by hand, which means it is an invariant somebody has to
rem remember.
rem
rem So this file fills the stack region with strings and then prints
rem numbers through the same slots. If a numeric push ever stops
rem clearing the string, the separator read finds stale text and the
rem program dies with a PRINT syntax mismatch rather than printing
rem something slightly wrong.
