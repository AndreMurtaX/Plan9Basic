rem ---------------------------------------------------------------
rem Compound assignment on array elements.
rem
rem `a#[i] += v` needs the array pointer and the index TWICE -- once
rem to read the element and once to write it back -- and the obvious
rem implementation emits the index expression a second time. That is
rem wrong, and silently: `a#[nextSlot()] += 1` would call nextSlot
rem twice and update a different element from the one it read.
rem
rem The internal registers cannot hold the indices either. There are
rem three and dim# takes up to ten dimensions, so a register-based
rem version works for a#[i] and runs out at a#[i,j,k,l] -- which is
rem the kind of rule that makes a feature not worth having.
rem
rem So the values are computed once and copied on the stack by DUPN.
rem The section named "index-evaluated-once" is the one that would
rem fail on any other implementation.
