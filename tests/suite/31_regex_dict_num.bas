rem ---------------------------------------------------------------
rem The three small remainders: RegexLib 10/16, DictLib 16/20 and
rem NumLib 23/32. All three had the same shape of gap -- the parts
rem the applets in Examples/ call and never check.
rem
rem Note the argument order throughout RegexLib: the PATTERN comes
rem first and the text second, which is the opposite of instr and of
rem most of StrLib.
rem ---------------------------------------------------------------

test_case("regex/positions")
rem regex_findpos and regex_findlen describe the first match without
rem extracting it, which is what a caller needs to cut the string up
rem itself.
rem
rem POSITIONS HERE ARE 1-BASED, and absence is 0. instr in the same
rem engine is 0-based with -1 for absence, so the two disagree about
rem the same match by one and about failure entirely. Both are
rem documented; they are simply not documented as being different.

assert_eq(regex_findpos("[0-9]+", "no digits here"), 0, "absence is zero here")
assert_eq(instr("no digits here", "12345"), -1, "and minus one there")

test_case("regex/findall")
rem regex_findall# answers a string list, so StrListLib reads it back.
all# = regex_findall#("[0-9]+", "1 then 22 then 333")

none# = regex_findall#("[0-9]+", "nothing")
assert_eq(strings_count(none#), 0, "and an empty list when there is nothing to find")

test_case("regex/groups")
rem A group is a bracketed part of the pattern, and group ZERO is the
rem whole match -- so three brackets make four groups, and the list
rem starts with the match itself rather than with the first bracket.
date$ = "2020-06-15"

assert_eq(regex_group$("([0-9]{4})-([0-9]{2})", date$, 1), "2020", "regex_group$ reads one by number")

test_case("dict/queries")
rem dict_exists asks without reading, which is the difference between

assert_true(len(dict_key$(d#, 0)), "dict_key$ names one by position")
rem dict_type answers a code: 0 numeric, 1 string, 2 pointer. Numeric
rem being zero means the obvious truth test reads an ordinary numeric
rem dictionary as "no type".

assert_eq(pnttonum(pdict_getdef#(p#, "absent", fallback#)), 4242, "and one that is not answers the default")

test_case("num/hyperbolic")

rem minus sinh squared is one, and each inverse undoes its own function.

test_case("num/atan2")
rem atan2 knows which quadrant it is in, which is the whole reason it
rem takes two arguments instead of their ratio.
rem
rem This engine has no pi: NumLib registers acos, asin, atan and
rem degtorad but no constant for it, and Examples/03_numlib_test.bas
rem opens by assigning one by hand. degtorad(180) is that number
rem exactly, and costs a function call rather than fourteen digits.
p = degtorad(180)
assert_near(atan2(0, 1), 0, 0.0001, "along the positive x axis")

assert_near(atan2(0, -1), p, 0.0001, "half a turn round")
assert_near(atan2(-1, 0), -p / 2, 0.0001, "and a quarter turn down")

test_case("num/int-and-compare")
rem int and fix are the classic BASIC pair and they part on negatives:
rem int goes DOWN and fix goes TOWARDS ZERO. On positives they agree,
rem which is why a program can use either for years and then meet the
rem difference the first time a number goes below zero.
assert_eq(int(3.7), 3, "int drops the fraction")

assert_eq(int(-3.7), -4, "int goes down")
