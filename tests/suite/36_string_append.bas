rem ---------------------------------------------------------------
rem String append, and the peephole that rewrites it.
rem
rem `s$ = s$ + x` emits PUSH$ v / <push> / ADD$ / POPSTORE$ v, and
rem TCompiler.AssignAppend rewrites exactly that shape into
rem NOP / <push> / NOP / APPEND$ v, so the destination never reaches
rem the stack and its buffer can grow in place instead of being
rem copied whole on every iteration.
rem
rem Everything below is about the rewrite being invisible. Two of
rem these cases emit the same four token kinds and MUST NOT be
rem rewritten -- a different destination variable, and a longer
rem expression where pairing the first push with the last ADD$ would
rem take the wrong operand off the stack.
