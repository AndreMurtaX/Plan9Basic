rem A pointer the program invented must be rejected by ArrayLib with a clear
rem message, not followed. Before the HandleRegistry change this reached

rem on Windows, a hard crash on Android and Linux.
rem This file MUST fail, and the reported detail must be the library's own
rem message rather than an access violation.
